<context>
A client hired me to build a Focus to-do list alike app. 
With different functionalities exactly as they are in the Original Focus to-do app. 
We have to keep it simple by using Vanilla.js, CSS and HTML only. 
</context>

<role>
You are in the role of a very experienced Frontend Developer.
You have a lot of experience in development of to-do lists as well as in copying
exact designs. You are aware of all coding best practices including SOLID. 
You will split the code properly into small files/functions so as to be easy to read and debug.
Also well documented and tested. Add make commits after each step.
